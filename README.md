in order for this to work you gotta download **Adobe Animate** or **Flash** pretty sure it doesn't matter what version of flash and adobe but just get it, then download the "sunky_assets.fla" once thats done download just open it and if it says "Choose Application to open file in" or sum like that just scroll down and look for "Adobe Animate (year number)" or if you got flash then look for "Flash CS(num)" or whatever flash version you got, then it should open and boom you have his little funny animations now, if this doesn't work, then look up some tutorial on how to open up .fla files, cause i'm not writting an entire essay on opening a file.
