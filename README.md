in order for this to work you gotta download **Adobe Animate** or **Flash** pretty sure it doesn't matter what version of flash and adobe but just get it, then download the "sunky_assets.fla" once thats done download just open it and if it says "Choose Application to open file in" or sum like that just scroll down and look for "Adobe Animate (year number)" or if you got flash then look for "Flash CS(num)" or whatever flash version you got, then it should open and boom you have his little funny animations now, if this doesn't work, then look up some tutorial on how to open up .fla files, cause i'm not writting an entire essay on opening a file.


Just incase you dont feel like downloading a zip file and extracting it, i got you, just create a new folder anywhere you want call it whatever you want too, then open it up and then look for the little top bar that should say sum like ("This PC > (Directory) > (Folder Name)") then click on it delete the text then type in that bar "cmd" then command prompt should open up, then just type in: "git clone https://github.com/SMSomeGuy/fnf-sunky-fla-file-assets" and then it should say sum like (extracting into vajgajguajg) then once it says (Done) you can close cmd then once you look back at the folder you made, there should be another folder called "fnf-sunky-fla-file-assets" just click in the folder and then you should find 2 things "README" and "sunky_assets" and if you have the option where you can see hidden folders in windows then you should see another folder called ".git" and it should be colored in a dark shade of grey, but the main thing you want is "sunky_assets.fla" assuming that you have adobe/flash just double click it and then it should open up adobe/flash and then you should be good to go. -- This is for windows so, if you use a mac or sum idk what to do about that so uh, sorry i guess.


And if, adobe doesn't open or nothing just happened give it some time, and if nothing still happens after like 5 mins somethings wrong with your adobe/flash lmao.
and if it does open but evverything is just like gray and like a few blocks and something on top that says "File" "new" stuff like that just wait and it will eventually load. Still need help? welp find some help elsewhere since i don't know everything about adobe/flash.
